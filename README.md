# Hi, I'm Yaniv <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="15px"> 🏊🚴🏃 💻 🦀

I'm a **Embedded Security Engineer** and I'm passionate about **technology** and everything related to the cloud computing, especially **TODO**.

I'm passionate about **problem-solving, statistics and algorithms**. One of my favourites topics in Computer Science is **Data Structures** and I love to create all sort of algorithms to help me solve problems. I guess one of the best qualities a Developer can have is ***analytical thinking*** 

I care deeply about unlocking the power of technology for individuals and businesses, so they can use computers in a way that was previously unrealistic for them. I find joy in ambiguity and unknown and feel more engaged when working on problems that can't be solved by merely searching the web or reading a book. Bonus points if I can collaborate with a team of like-minded engineers!

I love to code :computer:, surf :surfer: and learn new things :books:!

## My stack is as follows ⚡
* **Backend**: Rust, C/C++, Python 
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jest, Jenkins


## Current situation ✨
